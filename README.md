# Python-Workshop

Hello everyone, welcome to my workshop: Introduction to Python.
The goal is to make you familiar with the basic usage of Python.
I will first give an explanation about Python and afterwards we can start with doing some fun tutorials. 

## Installation guide
The latest version of Python is Python 3.8.3.
[Download Python here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Next up is something to writ Python code. Currently I am using Visual studio code, [Click if you want to use this text editor on steroids](https://code.visualstudio.com/). You can also pick an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) specifically for Python. The one I can recommend for now is [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). The choice is up to you. If you want another I would suggest that you you have a look on the world wide web. There is plenty of choice.

If everyone has downloaded his python version and something to write Python code then we are set to go.
